# LM_Bioinformatics_HMM_KunitzDomain
This is a computational pipeline for building a profile Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for the Kunitz-type protease inhibitor domain (Pfam ID: PF00014). Kunitz domains are known to inhibit the proteolytic activity of a protein family called proteases. Some examples of Kunitz-type protease inhibitors include aprotinin (bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor, BPTI), Alzheimer's amyloid precursor protein (APP), and tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI).
An HMM model was constructed and calibrated using structure-based multiple alignemnt (PDBeFOLD) of representative Kunitz-type protease inhibitors.




This project was carried out as part of the Laboratory of Bioinformatics 1 during my MSc in Bioinformatics at the University of Bologna (Alma Mater Studiorum), aiming  to integrate approaches from structural bioinformatics, sequence analysis, and statistical validation of predictive models.




This pipeline could lead to a better understanding of the biological aspects between these particular type of domain and their targets and so it could 

## Main aim
Building a Profile Hidden Markov Model for the Kunitz-type protease inhibitor domain. 

## Kunitz domains
Kunitz domains are the active domains of proteins that inhibit the function of protein degrading enzymes or, more specifically, domains of Kunitz-type are protease inhibitors.
Examples of Kunitz-type protease inhibitors are aprotinin (bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor, BPTI), Alzheimer's amyloid precursor protein (APP), and tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI).
