# LM_Bioinformatics_HMM_KunitzDomain
This is a computational pipeline for building a profile Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for the Kunitz-type protease inhibitor domain (Pfam ID: PF00014). Kunitz domains are known to inhibit the proteolytic activity of a protein family called proteases. Some examples of Kunitz-type protease inhibitors include aprotinin (bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor, BPTI), Alzheimer's amyloid precursor protein (APP), and tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI).
An HMM model was constructed and calibrated using structure-based multiple alignemnt (PDBeFOLD) of representative Kunitz-type protease inhibitors.To evaluate its performance, the model was tested against both positive sequences (known Kunitz domains) and negative controls (non-Kunitz proteins).

This project was carried out as part of the Laboratory of Bioinformatics 1 during my MSc in Bioinformatics at the University of Bologna (Alma Mater Studiorum), aiming  to integrate approaches from structural bioinformatics, sequence analysis, and statistical validation of predictive models. 

## Needed Packages
To ensure a smooth and reproducible workflow, we created a dedicated Conda environment including all the necessary bioinformatics tools. The following packages were installed:

CD-HIT – for clustering and comparing large sets of sequences

HMMER – for searching sequence databases using profile hidden Markov models

BLAST+ – for performing sequence similarity searches

Biopython – for working with biological data in Python

This setup ensures compatibility and simplifies dependency management throughout the project.
