# LM_Bioinformatics_HMM_KunitzDomain

## Main aim
Building a Profile Hidden Markov Model for the Kunitz-type protease inhibitor domain. 

## Kunitz domains
Kunitz domains are the active domains of proteins that inhibit the function of protein degrading enzymes or, more specifically, domains of Kunitz-type are protease inhibitors.
Examples of Kunitz-type protease inhibitors are aprotinin (bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor, BPTI), Alzheimer's amyloid precursor protein (APP), and tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI).
